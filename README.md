An intriguing and involving game developed using Java and Swing.The rules of the game are quite straightforward but the gameplay is pretty involving and intresting. Basically, there are two players involved and each player gets a color and gets to chose a square in a grid the only rule is that a single player cannot pick two squares which are adjacent to each other. The moment a player choses (or is forced to chose) a square that is adjacent to another square picked by the same player they lose the game.
